("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

	<h4>14. NO WAIVER</h4>

<a class="privacy-policy" id="privacy"><h4>INSPIRED PRIVACY POLICY</h4></a>
	<p>We at Invidio, Inc., the creators of Inspired, ( hereinafter "Invidio,""Inspired," "we," "us," or "our") know that our users ("you," "your," or "yourself") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our TERMS OF USE.
	</p>

	<h4>I. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h4>
	<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website.

To this end we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our TERMS OF USE). If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.
	</p>

	<h4>II. WHAT INFORMATION DOES INSPIRED COLLECT?</h4>
	<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to, among other things, personalize and improve our services, allow our users to set up a user account and profile, contact users, fulfill your requests for certain products and services, analyze how users utilize the Website, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as described in this Section and in Section III below). We collect the following types of information:</p>
	<h5>A. Information You Provide to Us:</h5>
	<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. By way of illustrative example and by no means limiting, we collect Personal Information including  your name, username, phone number, credit card and other billing information, email address, shipping address, and your friends’ email addresses (which we will only use in order to invite them to use the Service), and your third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or similar). We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests. If you access the Service through Facebook Connect or similar, you understand that some content and/or information in your Facebook account (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with Inspired if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features.</p>
	<p>We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymized information to our partners. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. By way of further example we may use the fact you have purchased or inquired about a certain brand of apparel to show you advertisements for the company that sells that brand.</p>
	<h5>B. Information Collected Automatically:</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your computer’s or device’s acceptance of cookies, but doing so may prevent you from taking advantage of some of the Website’s features. Additionally, our advertising partners may transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover cookies delivered to you by any of our advertisers.</li>
		<li>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website and to which pages within the Website), we only use such data, in aggregate form, in a manner that assures your anonymity. We may provide this aggregate usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that our partners, too, can endeavor to provide you with an optimal online experience. For an illustrative but not fully inclusive example, we may place a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on our Website, and then provide that information, in non-personally-identifiable form, to a third party website, to allow such website to show you ads for similar products that are available from Inspired or from third parties.•	We may deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an advertising network partners. Web beacons allow advertising networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. For example these beacons maylog that you have viewed a certain product on our Website, and then show you an ad for similar products when you browse to another website. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Many ad networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards, and such NAI members may allow you to opt-out of cookies or beacons they deliver.We do not control the policies of any third parties, including advertising networks.</li>

You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that we deem it relates to such transaction or service. By way of illustrative example one such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit information from your Inspired account to an account on a third party website or service, such as Facebook or similar. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’s or websites’ policies.</p>
